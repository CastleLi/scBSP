Description: Identifying spatially variable genes is critical in linking molecular cell functions 
	with tissue phenotypes. This package utilizes a granularity-based dimension-agnostic tool, 
	single-cell big-small patch (scBSP), implementing sparse matrix operation and KD tree 
	method for distance calculation, for the identification of spatially variable genes on 
	large-scale data. The detailed description of this method is available at Wang, J. 
	and Li, J. et al. 2023 (Wang, J. and Li, J. (2023), <doi:10.1038/s41467-023-43256-5>).
